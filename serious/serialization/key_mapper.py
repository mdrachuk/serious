"""Map dataclass field names to different keys when serializing.

The biggest case to remap keys is switch between dataclass snake_case and JSON camelCase traditions.
We honor foreign traditions, so the JSON model does by default.

Remapping is implementing by creating a custom KeyMapper and passing it as a parameter to `SeriousModel`.

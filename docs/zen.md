# PEP-20 — The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
[Source](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

Beautiful is better than ugly.<br/>
Explicit is better than implicit.<br/>
Simple is better than complex.<br/>
Complex is better than complicated.<br/>
Flat is better than nested.<br/>
Sparse is better than dense.<br/>
Readability counts.<br/>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br/>
Although practicality beats purity.<br/>
Errors should never pass silently.<br/>
Unless explicitly silenced.<br/>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br/>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br/>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br/>
Now is better than never.<br/>
Although never is often better than *right* now.<br/>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br/>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br/>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
